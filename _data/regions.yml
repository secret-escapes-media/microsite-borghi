  description: Apulia is distilled Italian charm, where long Mediterranean beaches are lapped by azure waters and fringe an interior beset with romantic hilltop villages. The food is delicious and the wine is unforgettable. For too long, tourism has neglected the wider region in favour of its capitals, missing out on the Baroque marvel of Lecce, the iconic trulli – the rather odd conical folk houses – and the white-washed Borghi of the region’s north. A true foodie region, seafood is abundant, bread from here is coveted, and Apulian primitivo flows from every enoteca. Lose yourself in the hilltop towns, head to the beach and discover the real Apulia.

  description: Famed for captivating white-sand beaches with remarkably clear waters, brightly coloured seaside towns and a host of idiosyncrasies, Sardinia is in no way a typical Italian destination. Even the staples of any Italian trip are done differently – the pasta is different, as is the wine. The mountainous interior offers a wild landscape, littered with the iconic nuraghi Bronze Age ruins that pop up as frequently as the irresistible Borghi which sit high on hills across the island. Oddities like the street art that adorns the walls of Orgosolo, or the island full of roaming albino donkeys, complete any Sardinian experience.
